# JSON-RPC server for the Hiero SDK TCK.
#
# Build context is the repository root, so build it from there:
#   docker build -f /path/to/action/dockerfiles/js_sdk.Dockerfile \
#     -t hiero-sdk-js-tck .
#
# This differs from the tck/Dockerfile already in the repository, which installs
# @hiero-ledger/sdk from npm and therefore tests the published package. This one
# builds the SDK from the checkout and installs that, so a pull request is
# tested against its own changes. It needs the repository root as its context
# for that reason - tck/Dockerfile expects the context to be tck/ itself.

# builds with. package.json declares no packageManager field, so corepack has
